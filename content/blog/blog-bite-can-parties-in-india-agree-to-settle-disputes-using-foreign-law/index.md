[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/433430/Arbitration+Dispute+Resolution/Whether+Indian+Parties+Can+Choose+Foreign+Law+To+Settle+Disputes) uses case law to illustrate that the Courts in India have not offered consistently decided whether parties can rely on foreign law to settle disputes. As a result, contract drafters may face legal issues if they choose to agree to settle disputes with foreign law in India.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
