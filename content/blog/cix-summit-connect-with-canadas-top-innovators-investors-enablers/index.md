In mid october our partner organization is hosting the Canadian Innovation Exchange (CIX) Summit.

CIX is the biggest "who's who" event of the year. You 'must attend' if you are a technology innovator or investor. Look for our Clausehound banner and come say hello to our team members who will be wearning our Clausehound orange.

Whether you are entrepreneur, investor or service provider CIX is a great event to network with representatives on every level of the industry. If you're interested register before Sept. 15 to get $50 off.
