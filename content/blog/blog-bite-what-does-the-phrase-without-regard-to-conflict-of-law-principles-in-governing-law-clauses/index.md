[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/594906/Contract+Law/Governing+Law+Clauses+Without+Regard+To+Conflict+Of+Law) seeks to explain the purpose of a specific provision in governing law clause "without regard to conflict of law principles". The author identifies two reasons for this provision. First, it does not allow a party to try to apply a law other than the express jurisdiction of governing law. Second, it prevents a renvoi which would allow for a court to refer to laws involving foreign jurisdiction in a conflict of law analysis. The author indicates that this is important for ensuring that the intention of the parties are maintained.
