[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/421506/Contract+Law/Indemnity+Clause+And+Limitation+Of+Liability+In+Business+Acquisition+Transactions) looks at how limitation of liability is negotiated against indemnity through measures like caps, time periods, and using qualifying language in the agreement (e.g., "to the best of the party's knowledge" or "the party has, in all material respects, done so).

 This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
