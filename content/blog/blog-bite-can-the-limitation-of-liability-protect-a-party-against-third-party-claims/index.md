[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/463014/cycling+rail+road/Railway+Law+Client+Alert+Scope+Of+Limitation+Of+Liability+Clauses+In+Rail+Tariffs+Considered+By+Federal+Court+Of+Appeal) looks at the relationship between shippers and railways to discuss how the latter's liability can be limited for third party claims so long as they are not negligent, the terms comply with relevant legislation, or the parties have mutually agreed upon other terms.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
