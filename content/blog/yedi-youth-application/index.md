[YEDI Application](http://www.yedinstitute.org/apply/youthapply/)

Our partner organization YEDI, has opened up a call for applications for a youth business incubator.

YEDI is seekind unique and innovative for-profit venture or not-for-profit organizations that are in raw, seed, early, or growth stages.

This is important for you, our entrepreneur and startup community, because IMHO it is NEVER too early to start down the entrepreneurial path.
