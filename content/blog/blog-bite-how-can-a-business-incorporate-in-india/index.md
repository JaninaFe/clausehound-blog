People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/565572/Corporate+Commercial+Law/MCA+Notifies+The+Incorporation+Amendment+Rules+2017+Doing+Business+In+India+Further+SPICed+And+Digitized) highlights key changes to the rules for the incorporation of a company in India. Namely, the new rules simplify forms which must be submitted and allow for digital submission, digital signatures and more streamlined processes and timeframes.

Corporate registrants in all jurisdictions should be sure to make themselves aware of the minimum information and filing requirements in their jurisdiction of incorporation, as well as the elements of their filing that will become a matter of public record.
