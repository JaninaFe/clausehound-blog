[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/59570/Insolvency+Bankruptcy/Assignee+Bank+May+Seek+Recovery+Based+On+Lost+Promissory+Note) discusses an Alabama Supreme Court decision that held that the assignee of a lost promissory note was entitled to rely on a lost note affidavit to enforce its claim against the maker of the note. Although the court applied principles of common law, courts in other jurisdictions or countries might rule differently.
