[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/466048/Contract+Law/Governing+Law+And+Choice+Of+Forum+Clauses) discusses how parties who are from different provinces can decide together upon what governing law their contract shall preside under. If such a clause is not included, the courts can look at contextual factors (e.g., location of parties) to make a determination.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
