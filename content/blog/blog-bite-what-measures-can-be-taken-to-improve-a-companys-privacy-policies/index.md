[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/493336/data+protection/Privacy+why+does+it+matter) is discussing how companies can better prepare their privacy matters to mitigate issues with trade secrets and intellectual property. The author provides a number of suggestions to achieve this. First, the author suggests that companies need to establish a policy that is frequently updated to manage information and privacy complaints. Second, the author wants companies to consider how their information is being used and collected to ensure that efforts are not being wasted on unimportant data and also have to consider cross-border data. His final two recommendations are the security measures that should be undertaken by the company and to prepare for the inevitable human breach.
