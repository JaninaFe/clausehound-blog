Prior to sending your drafted agreement to a counterparty of executing the agreement, it is important to thoroughly review the agreement for both content and form. These are some of the key items that a drafter should keep in mind when reviewing an agreement.

-is the service/product/good correctly described?-do the numbers line up with what was agreed between the parties?-do the time lines correspond to realistic ability to perform the contract?-is the pricing clear?-does the contract contain a limit or cap on liability exposure under the agreement?-is the ‘business’ properly defined for the purposes of confidentiality, non- solicitation and non-competition purposes?
