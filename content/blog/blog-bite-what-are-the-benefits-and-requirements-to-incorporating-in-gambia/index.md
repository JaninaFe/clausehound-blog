People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/379084/offshore+financial+centres/Gambia+LLC+Corporate+Environment+Summary) outlines the requirements of incorporating in Gambia and its desirable characteristics. The articles states that Gambia offshore can be used for holding bank accounts, promotion of international business, leasing vehicles and borrowing money. It also illustrates what is required to incorporate such as government fees and certificate of incorporations.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
