People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/7406/Environmental+Law/A+Guide+To+International+Business+Companies+In+The+Bahamas) provides a summary of the principal provisions of the International Business Companies Act, which is the statute that governs or the incorporation, registration and operation of International Business Companies in the Bahamas. The author highlights the relevant particulars that must be in IBC's Memorandum of Association, as well as winding up procedures.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
