People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/569902/Corporate+Commercial+Law/NEW+Incorporation+Of+A+Company+With+1+Equity+SARLS) states that it is now possible to incorporate a company with equity and with reduced costs and fees via an alternative structure to the ordinary Limited Liability Company (or S.A.R.L.-S). The article further states the changes to this structure and its requirements.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
