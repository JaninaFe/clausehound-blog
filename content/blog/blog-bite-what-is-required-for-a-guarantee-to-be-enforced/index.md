[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/45284/Directors+Officers/Guarantees+The+Risks+Of+Unclear+Documents+And+Entire+Agreement+Clauses) looks at a judgement where a court found that a company that was owed fees by a director who assured he would pay did not constitute a guarantee. For the guarantee to be enforced, it must be given in writing and signed by the guarantor, and in this case, a formal guarantee made afterwards superseded any previous agreement in accordance with the Entire Agreement clause.
