People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/195618/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Relevant+Aspects+For+The+Incorporation+Of+Companies+In+Honduras) discusses the relevant provisions for incorporating a business in Honduras. It states that it takes between 10 to 12 business days to finish incorporation and begin operations. Foreign companies may have additional steps required to incorporate in this country.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
