[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/274590/Licensing+Syndication/A+Practical+Guide+to+Software+License+Agreements+Governing+Law+and+Dispute+Resolution) highlights some considerations for software licensees and licensors vis-a-vis governing law and dispute resolution. Chiefly, it suggests that parties should strive to select governing law having obtained appropriate legal advice rather than leaving it unspecified, and that dispute resolution processes should strive to be fair to both parties.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
