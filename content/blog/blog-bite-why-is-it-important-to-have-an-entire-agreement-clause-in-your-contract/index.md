[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/563228/employment+litigation+tribunals/Employment+Agreement+Can+Include+Cover+Email+Presenting+It) looks at case law to show that if a contract does not include an entire agreement clause, materials other than the contract (e.g., emails) can be construed by the courts as part of the agreement and factor into the case at hand.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
