[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/134582/Contract+Law/Contracting+With+Suppliers+A+Balanced+Approach+To+Indemnities+And+Limitations+Of+Liability) points out that the language of indemnity (maximizing damages received) is at odds with that of limitation of liability (minimizing damages given), so they should be considered in conjunction.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
