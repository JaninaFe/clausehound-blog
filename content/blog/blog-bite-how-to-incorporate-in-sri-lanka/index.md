[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/202600/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Formation+of+Companies+in+Sri+Lanka+an+easy+to+follow+checklist) explains the steps to incorporation in Sri Lanka and the required characteristics of an incorporated company. The author differentiates the registration procedure between Guarantee Limited Company and Associations as well.

This article is also helpful for non citizens of Sri Lanka in understanding some of the issues to consider when incorporating, as well as to understand the industries in which there is a restriction placed upon foreign business ownership.
