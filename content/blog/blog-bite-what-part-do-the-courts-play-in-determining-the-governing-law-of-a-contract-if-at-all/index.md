[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/39956/Contract+Law/A+Canadian+Perspective+Choice+of+Law+and+Choice+of+Forum) discusses how the courts favor leaving the decision of governing law up to the parties.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
