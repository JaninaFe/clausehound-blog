People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/482182/wealth+management/Panamanian+Corporations+Their+Usefulness+Advantages+And+Benefits) highlights the benefits and advantages of incorporating in Panama, including tax benefits, less strict meeting requirements, and the free movement of funds absent a bi-lateral agreement. The article also states the steps required to incorporate in Panama and what the articles of incorporation are required to contain.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
