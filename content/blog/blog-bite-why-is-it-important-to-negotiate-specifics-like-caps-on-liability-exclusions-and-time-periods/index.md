[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/91134/Insurance/Limitation+of+liability+clauses+in+contracts+What+makes+them+effective) points out that if this clause is worded too broadly or ambiguously, the courts can interpret it as disproportionately benefiting the party putting it forth and therefore invalidate it. As a result, it is important to negotiate on specifics like caps on liability, exclusions, and time periods.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
