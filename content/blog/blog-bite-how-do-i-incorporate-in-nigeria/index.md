People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/Nigeria/x/571666/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Procedure+For+Registration+Of+Private+Companies+Limited+By+Shares+In+Nigeria) discusses the procedure, documents and eligibility requirements to incorporate a company in Nigeria. The Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) is the governing law that regulates company practice in Nigeria.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
