[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/404.asp?action=login&amp;404;http://www.mondaq.com:80/canada/x/242054/employment%20litigation%20tribunals/Independent%20Contractors%20And%20Their%20Rights%20Upon%20Termination=) denotes the significance of an Ontario Superior Court decision in which the court held that the non-exclusive nature of a consulting agreement disentitled the claimant from receiving the full amount of the contract for his early termination. The court awarded the claimant only the value of the time spent on the project prior to termination, but also expressed its disapproval of the defendant's mistreatment towards the claimant by awarding punitive damages and substantial costs as well.
