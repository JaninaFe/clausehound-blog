[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/420940/Contract+Law/Court+of+Appeal+Clarifies+Enforceability+of+Entire+Agreement+Clauses) uses case law to discuss the enforceability of entire agreement clauses since courts are more and more taking into account pre-contractual and post-contractual details in cases. To circumvent this, the clause should explicitly address such matters.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
