People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/italy/x/199958/Corporate+Commercial+Law/The+Process+of+Company+Incorporation+in+Italy) describes three types of limited liability companies in Italy namely S.p.A. ("societa per azioni," equivalent to public limited company (PLC)), S.R.L. ("societa a responsabilita limitata," which corresponds with private limited company (LTD)), and S.a.p.a. ("societa in accomandita per azioni," partnership limited by shares). The author discusses the steps required to incorporate each of the aforementioned company types. The author also highlights the differences between each of the types.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
