People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/hongkong/x/323282/offshore+financial+centres/Hong+Kong+Private+Limited+Companies+Incorporation) documents various requirements for the incorporation of Hong Kong private limited companies. For instance, the author notes the number of directors, shareholders, and company secretaries required (and the role of restrictions on who can fill those positions), the frequency required for annual general meetings, and the procedure of incorporation, among others.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
