[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/297426/employee+rights+labour+relations/STANDARD+CLAUSES+AND+NOTING+THE+FINE+PRINT+DIVISIONAL+COURT+WEIGHS+IN) looks at case law to discuss how the level of sophistication of parties can determine the enforceability of entire agreement clauses.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
