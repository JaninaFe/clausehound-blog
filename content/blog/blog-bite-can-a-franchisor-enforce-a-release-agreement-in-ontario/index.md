[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/177732/Franchising/Obtaining+A+Release+When+A+Franchise+Has+Gone+Sour) examines the Ontario case of Dodd v. Prime Restaurants of Canada, in which one issue was whether a signed release between a franchisor and franchisee was unconscionable and violated section 11 of the Arthur Wishart Act. The article notes that such a release might bar common law and equitable claims even if it cannot operate to bar claims under the Act, and that such decisions are matters to be determined at trial.
