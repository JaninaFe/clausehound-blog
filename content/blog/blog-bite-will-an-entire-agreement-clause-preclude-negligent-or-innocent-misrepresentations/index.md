[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/526156/Contract+Law/Whole+Agreement+Clause+Upheld+by+Court+of+Appeal) uses case law to discuss the enforceability of entire agreement clauses. The article states that entire agreement clauses will be enforced where they reflect the intent of both parties.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
