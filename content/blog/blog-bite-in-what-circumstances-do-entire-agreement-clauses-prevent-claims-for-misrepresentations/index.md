[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/144800/Contract+Law/Entire+Agreement+Clauses) discusses the importance of explicit language in entire agreement clauses. To prevent a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a clause must either state that no representations have been made, no representations have been relied upon, or explicitly state that parties will not be liable for any misrepresentations.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
