[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/186370/trials+appeals+compensation/Employment+Newsletter+June+2012) advises businesses to ensure that governing law clauses are drafted so as to clearly identify what law will govern claims arising from disputes between parties to an international contract. There exists a plethora of differences between the legal systems worldwide (e.g., different protections, procedures, limitation periods).

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
