People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/2342/Environmental+Law/Incorporation+Of+Mauritius+International+Companies+In+Chinese+Language) describes International Companies (ICs) and its main features: tax exemption, capital requirements, filing requirements, and meeting locations. Articles of incorporation are also permitted to be in either English or Chinese.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
