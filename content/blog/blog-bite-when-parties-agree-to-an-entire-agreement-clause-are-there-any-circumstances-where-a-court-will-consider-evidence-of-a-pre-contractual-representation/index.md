[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/151374/Commercial/The+Effectiveness+Of+Entire+Agreement+Clauses+Principles+And+Exceptions) discusses a Quebec decision to illustrate the circumstances where a Court will consider pre-contractual evidence, not withstanding an entire agreement clause. According to the case, a court may consider pre-contractual evidence in cases where there is evidence of fraud, evidence of error, where representations have been made, where there is a consumer contract, in contracts contrary to public order, and where there is ambiguous clauses.
