We hope that you have found Clausehound useful in your review and edits of the contractor agreement assigned. We thought we’d check in mid-way and also wanted to provide you with some additional information that you may find helpful.
Firstly, in regards to pushing variant language/clauses that you see on the left hand side of the screen into the contract. We have created an instructional video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTQF8x6IAQ0&amp;feature=youtu.be) to provide clarity. You will see in the video that you can insert clauses from the left into the contract based on where you selected.

Secondly, in regards to one of your assignment questions about changing the ordering of the provisions, this would be best done in Word after you have made your edits on Clausehound and have downloaded the document.

For those of you that haven’t yet registered to Clausehound, you can do so at the link[ here.](https://clausehound.com/?usertype=lpp)
