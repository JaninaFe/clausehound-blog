People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/brazil/x/332058/Corporate+Governance/Establishing+A+Company+In+Brazil) discusses the method in which a foreign company may establish itself in Brazil, either through a branch or subsidiary. The article suggests that establishing a presence in Brazil through subsidiary is more common. Limited liability companies and corporations are the most common approach to establishing a subsidiary. The article further discusses the steps to incorporation and the difference between LLC and corporations.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
