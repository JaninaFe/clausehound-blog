Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be a part of a cohort full of like-minded entrepreneurs? The LEAP Junction provides a glimpse into the first half of their current cohort’s entrepreneurial  journey. Ten entrepreneurs, all set out to pursue their businesses, gather together for nine weeks of training. One of the biggest benefits of participating in cohort-based programs like LEAP Junction is working with a wide range of  businesses - each with completely different goals and challenges. 

 

At LEAP, entrepreneurs begin their journey with incredibly informative workshops that address many of the fundamental opportunities and challenges entrepreneurs face in their pursuit of growth.
