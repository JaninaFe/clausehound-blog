People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as (1) minimum director requirements; (2) favorable corporate taxes; (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. [This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/279080/Shareholders/Doing+Business+in+British+Columbia+2013) provides an extensive guide on both incorporating a business in the province of British Columbia, as well as the laws governing business regulation in general. Part "C" of this article provides a useful guide to businesses establishing in any jurisdiction, and this article also provides a survey of most of the topics of regulation that most businesses will need to consider.

This "blog bite" comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
