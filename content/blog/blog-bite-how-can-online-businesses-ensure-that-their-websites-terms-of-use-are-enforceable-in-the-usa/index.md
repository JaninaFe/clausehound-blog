[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/487396/IT+internet/The+Law+And+Business+of+Social+Media+Status+Updates) speaks about how online businesses can ensure that their website terms of use is enforceable. The author recommends that the website terms of use be displayed clearly. The author also suggests that users should be required to do something to prove that they have agreed to the terms of use. This can be done by requiring users to check a box. Lastly, it is recommended that businesses set up systems to track when users agree.
