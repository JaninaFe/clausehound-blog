[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/411990/Building+Construction/Limitation+of+Liability+Clauses+Are+They+Enforceable+and+Effective) uses case law to discuss the reach of limitation of liability clauses. For example, when a party to a project has a subcontractor who engages in negligent misrepresentation, the clause remains in effect to protect the party but not the subcontractor, who is held liable for full indemnities.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
