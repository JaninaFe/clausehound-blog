[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/202498/Contract+Law/Are+Entire+Agreement+Clauses+Entirely+Reliable) posits that the Courts in Australia have been inconsistent on deciding if an entire agreement clause can prevent claims of estoppel. The author states that the effectiveness of the clause when preventing representations and implied terms depends on the language of the clause.
