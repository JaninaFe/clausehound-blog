[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/ireland/x/326076/offshore+financial+centres/Ireland+Company+Incorporation) describes the features of a corporation in Ireland, notably that the company must have a real and substantive presence in Ireland and not merely a local registered office. The article highlights further requirements, including number of directors, registered office, and restrictions to company name.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
