[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/577416/Energy+Law/The+Inconvenient+Joint+Operating+Agreement) discusses an Alberta case to illustrate that Court's will enforce written agreements even where both parties have ignored the written agreement. The Court in this case relied on the written agreement's "entire agreement clause" to disregard evidence that contradicted the written agreement.
